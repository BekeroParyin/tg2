Cultures & Technology
Country management aspects rather than just city management
//Boats transporting goods
Boats transporting units

//Army Reworks:
-Add follow feature for armies so that they can follow allied armies/pursue enemy armies (noble levies will autofollow your units or else just patrol)

-Add patroling for armies (patroling armies will autofollow enemies within 2 tiles)

-Add optional autocharge for cavalry/maybe infantry

-Add supply wagons which carry food & can be raided

-Add castles which units can drop food off at and would have to be sieged
	Castles: Consist of a keep, a set of walls, and whatever buildings are built within the walls
	A castle is not considered finished until it is fully walled, but has no max size.
	Instead, the castle will cost gold per tile of its size (no gigacastles u apes)
